# Doppler-Imaging
-Simulated projectional temperature map of a geometrical star with finite number of surface elements
-Calculated the contribution to the overall line spectra for each projected surface element using rudimentary physical models and the doppler effect (forward method)
-Reconstructed the temperature map using machine learning techniques (inverse method)
